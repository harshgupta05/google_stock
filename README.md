## LSTM for Google Stock Price Prediction

### Overview

In this project, the objective is to prediction of Google stocks using time series.LSTMs are a complex area of deep learning. We will use Keras and LTSM -based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The data set that has used in this project has taken from the [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)


## Main Objective
#### The following points were the objective of the project :

* Data processing
* Model building
