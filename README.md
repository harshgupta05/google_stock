## LSTM for Google Stock Price Prediction

## Overview

In this project, the objective is to prediction of Google stocks using time series.LSTMs are a complex area of deep learning. We will use Keras and LTSM -based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The data set that has used in this project has taken from the [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

## Problem Statement

We are given Google stock price from 01/2012 to 12/2016. The task is to predict the trend of the stock price for 01/2017. Note that, based on Brownian Motion, the future variations of stock price are independent of the past. So, it is impossible to predict the exact stock price, but possible to predict and capture the upward and downward trends.
